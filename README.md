# GoogleCloudPriceList
This guide walks you through how to make use of GCP prices from your cloud console. This guide maybe useful for users that has a need to publish all GCP prices for their organization on a regular basis. This guide serves as a set of examples to filter, sort and export the GCP price data

Why do we need to do this? GCP has ~ 20,000 different SKUs available for end users to consume. For various organizations, it's often required to produce a list of usable SKUs as a part of RFP. This guide will help you get the prices filtered and arranged in the format that is required. 

Why do we use BigQuery? GCP has several price tiers for the same SKU. This repo attempts to guide users to filter out those products to have a single representation for a SKU
